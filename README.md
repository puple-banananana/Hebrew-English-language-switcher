# Hebrew-English-language-switcher
While this repo starts with this script, there will hopefully be others 

## Hebrew English language switcher
This script is to solve one specific problem with multi-Language keyboards: Starting to type something in one language and realising your keyboard is set to the wrong language.
Simply Select the text that is written in the wrong language, and the the hotkey Ctrl+Alt+Q to activate the script, it will replace any hebrew with the corespon×’ing english, and english with the coresponding hebrew. 

## V1.0.1: Added new feature!
Tray icon menu, with the options to auto change language when the script is triggered and the option to auto enable autostarting (copies shortcut to %AppData%/\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup), sadly this featur is sort of buggy, and will be fixed later on. currently simply press 'continue' when an error message pops up, the script will work fine from there.
